- 👀 I’m interested in **solving low-hanging problems and creating intuitive, meaningful results**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Dalamud plugin development and deepening my C# craft**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **anything my skill set can touch** — Windows and Linux systems/servers, SQL in most flavors, networks across the OSI model... (I’ll stop before this turns into a LinkedIn page. 😆)
- 📫 How to reach me: **Here, Discord (server coming soon!), or email — if you must lol.**
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **Once I start a project, you either get magic or mayhem — no in-between.**
